[1] Atomic_?.pdb (? = A, C, G, T or U) 
      Default standard nucleotides geometry used by 3DNA for analyzing
      and rebuilding full atomic nucleic acid structures in PDB format.

      Under the subdirectory atomic/, there are four sets of standard
      residue geometry files, ADNA_?.pdb, BDNA_?.pdb, NDB96_?.pdb and
      RNA_?.pdb. The base geometries by Clowney et al. (1996) are used
      throughout and they were downloaded from the NDB archive. The
      NDB96 set includes just base and C1' atoms, without backbone.  The
      ADNA set uses the C3'-endo sugar-backbone conformation as defined
      by Arnott's fiber studies, but with a chi torsion angle of -160
      degrees, average of high resolution single crystal X-ray
      oligonucleotide structures. The RNA set is the same as the ADNA
      set except for an additional O2' atom for each nucleotide. The
      BDNA set is similarly defined (-110 degrees chi torsion angle).

      The NDB96 set is the default. To use another set, simply copy them
      to overwrite the corresponding Atomic_?.pdb. A utility program,
      "x3dna_utils cp_std", can do this automatically for you. Other
      residue geometries can be used with the utility program
      "std_base".

[2] Block_BP.alc -- it defines the default base-pair (bp) rectangular
      block. It has a size of [10 x 4.5 x 0.5] (length x width x height,
      in angstroms) and is in ALCHEMY format. The bp is used for the
      Calladine-Drew style schematic presentation of DNA structures.

    Block_R.alc is for the purine bases [4.5 x 4.5 x 0.5]
    Block_Y.alc is for the pyrimidine bases [3.0 x 4.5 x 0.5]

      Under the subdirectory block/, there six block geometry files.
      Block_M.alc has half the size of BLOCK_BP.alc, and can be used if
      you would like the two blocks in a bp to be of the same
      size. Block_Ms.alc is slightly smaller in length than Block_M.alc
      to avoid possible overlaps in a compressed bp (i.e. with negative
      stretch). The blocks do not necessarily to be rectangular, as
      shown in Block_R_nr.alc.

[3] Pxyz.dat -- the xyz coordinates of phosphorus (P) atoms with regard
      to the middle dinucleotide reference frame. Four sets were
      defined, corresponding to average values in high resolution A- and
      B-DNA crystal structures, their mean value, and TA-DNA.  Users can
      add new sets following the format. This file is used by "rebuild"
      for generating DNA structures with only base and P atoms.

    PxyzH.dat is the same as above except the coordinates are given in
      the middle helical frames.

[4] fig_image.par -- parameters to style the generated XFig files, which
      can be edited (xfig) by users to suit their needs.

[5] ps_image.par -- parameters to define the style of the generated EPS
      files, which can be edited (Adobe Illustrator) by users to suit
      their needs.

[6] baselist.dat -- a comprehensive list of currently known nucleotides
    and their standard counterparts. It makes the analysis of unusual
    DNA and RNA structures straightforward. Strictly speaking, this list
    is no longer necessary since 3DNA can auto-detect a nucleotide based
    on atoms names and coordinates.

[7] misc_3dna.par -- geometric parameters for identifying bps and
    locating helical regions, mainly used by the "find_pair" program.

[8] my_header.r3d -- sample header file for Raster3D output
    my_header_hres.r3d -- output 160 * 16 pixel high-resolution image
    raster3d.par -- various styling parameters for Raster3d output

[9] The directory RNA_bases/ contains the standard bases for calculating
     Babcock and Olson's authentic "RNA" bp parameters (use "cehs -r").
